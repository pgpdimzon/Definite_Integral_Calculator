The DefiniteIntegralCalculator program computes for the definite integral 
of a simple polynomial function with the help of Apache Commons Math3 3.6.1 library.

The following inputs are needed in order for the program to run:
-Upper limit
-Lower limit
-Highest degree of polynomial
-Coefficients of polynomial

It is important to take in mind that the program can only compute in the following format:

ax^2 + bx + c

The users must input the coefficient with the highest degree down to the constant of the function.

If the user wishes to have an input of 3x^4 + 7x + 1, the resulting input that the program
will only accept is [3 0 0 7 1]. Each coefficient is separated by a single whitespace.
